Coursera Pegasus Utilities
==========================

These Pegasus utilities are used by both our Scala developers and our Java Android developers.
For this reason, they are implemented in Java and published to artifactory.


Typed Definition Codec
----------------------

The typed definition codec provides compatibility between Coursera's Play! JSON serialization,
namely `JsonFormats.typedDefinitionFormat()` and Pegasus data.

For details, see: `TypedDefinitionCodec.java`
